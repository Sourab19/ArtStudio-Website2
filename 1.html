        *The Starry Night* was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor
        studio, it is inaccurate to say it was painted purely from memory. The
        view depicted in the painting is identified as the one from his bedroom
        window, facing east, which Van Gogh painted in various forms at least
        twenty-one times. He mentioned in a letter to his brother, Theo, around
        May 1889 that he could see an enclosed wheat field from his window,
        where he would watch the sunrise each morning. Van Gogh created several
        variations of this view under different lighting conditions, weather,
        and times of day. Though the hospital staff didn't allow him to paint in
        his bedroom, he sketched the scenes using ink and charcoal, later
        refining them into full paintings. The consistent feature across these
        works is the diagonal line representing the low rolling hills of the
        Alpilles mountains and the cypress trees, which Van Gogh exaggerated in
        several paintings, notably in *The Starry Night*.

        *The Starry Night* is the only nocturne in the series of views from his
        bedroom window. Van Gogh's depiction of the night sky, particularly the
        prominent "morning star" near the cypress tree, is believed to represent
        Venus, which was visible at dawn in Provence during spring 1889. The
        Moon in the painting is stylized, as it was not astronomically accurate
        for the phase of the Moon at that time. The village depicted in the
        painting was not visible from Van Gogh's room and is based on a sketch
        made from a hillside above Saint-Rémy. This village scene includes a
        steeple that has been noted as more Dutch than Provençal, reflecting Van
        Gogh's earlier works from his time in Nuenen. The fusion of various
        landscapes and memories from different periods in his life is evident in
        this iconic work.
